## Fuctions
A fuction is a group of related statements that performs a specific task.
Fuctions help us breakdown our program into sections.

### DRY: Don't Repeat Yourself

### Formula
```python
def fuctionName(optional parameters)L
	#BODY
	#optional 'return' statements
```
To use a fuction, we have to **call** it.
`functionName(optional parameters)`
